# User Management System üöÄ

## Project Overview ‚ú®

The User Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to handle user authentication, authorization, and profile management. This project demonstrates modern development practices, quality assurance processes, and containerization techniques.

## Feature Implementation: User Profile Picture Upload üì∏

For this project, I implemented a complete **User Profile Picture Upload** feature that allows users to:

- Upload profile pictures in various formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Crop and resize images for optimal storage and display
- Replace existing profile pictures
- Remove profile pictures
- View profile pictures across different parts of the application

## Development Process üíª

### Local Setup

I successfully set up the development environment on my local machine, which included:
- Configuring the development server
- Setting up the database connection
- Installing all necessary dependencies
- Implementing environmental variables for secure configuration

### Quality Assurance üîç

I identified and resolved several issues related to the User Profile Picture Upload feature:

1. Fixed image validation to prevent malicious file uploads
2. Resolved image scaling issues on different device displays
3. Fixed storage path conflicts when users uploaded files with the same name
4. Addressed performance issues with large image uploads
5. Fixed browser compatibility issues with the image cropping tool

Each issue was thoroughly documented, including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and the implemented solution.

### Test Coverage Improvement ‚úÖ

I created comprehensive tests to ensure the reliability of the User Profile Picture Upload feature:

- Unit tests for image validation functions
- Integration tests for the upload API endpoints
- Tests for image processing utilities
- Error handling tests for invalid uploads
- Authentication tests for protected upload routes
- Tests for image retrieval functionality
- Performance tests for large file uploads
- Security tests to prevent unauthorized access
- Tests for concurrent upload scenarios
- Browser compatibility tests

These additional tests brought the overall test coverage to above 90%, ensuring robust functionality and reliability.

## Docker Deployment üê≥

The application has been successfully containerized and deployed as a Docker image:

- Created an optimized Dockerfile for production deployment
- Implemented multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Configured proper volume mapping for persistent storage
- Set up environment-specific configuration options
- Successfully pushed the image to Docker Hub

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Storage**: Configurable local/cloud storage
- **Testing**: Jest with Supertest
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker

This project demonstrates practical experience with real-world development scenarios, quality assurance practices, test coverage improvement, and professional deployment workflows.
